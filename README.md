# Ray The Caster

Simple Ray Caster in SDL

## General Info

I'm not a huge gamer, but I can remember how I felt when I first saw DOOM. I was
blown away by the immersive feeling and have been hooked on 3D graphics ever
since. While I normally like to focus on Ray Tracers, I was curious why people
kept claiming that DOOM (and Wolfenstein3D) were not "true 3D environments". 
After watching a couple of videos on the making of Wolfenstein3D I decided
to give a go to creating my own basic Ray Caster.

I am not hyper optimizing for memory or speed. While I am curious how hard it is
to get a basic 3D environment working I am favoring readability over
speed. I don't mind some basic optimizations, but I'm not going to go too
crazy with it.

I am also not really interested in texture maps, or complex lighting. I really just
want to create a basic space I can explore and then I'll likely call it good.
